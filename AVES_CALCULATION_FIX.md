# AVES Biogas Calculation Correction

## Issue Identified
The AVES (poultry) biogas potential values in the database were **triple** the correct amounts due to a calculation error.

## Problem Details
- **Column affected**: `biogas_aves_nm_ano`
- **Error**: Values were 3x higher than they should be
- **Impact**: Affected 577 municipalities with AVES biogas data
- **Root cause**: Error in original calculation methodology

## Correction Applied
**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Method**: Database correction script (`fix_aves_simple.py`)

### Changes Made:
1. **Divided all AVES values by 3**: `biogas_aves_nm_ano = biogas_aves_nm_ano / 3.0`
2. **Recalculated livestock totals**: `total_pecuaria_nm_ano` updated to reflect corrected AVES values
3. **Recalculated overall totals**: `total_final_nm_ano` updated to reflect corrected totals

## Impact Summary
- **AVES biogas before correction**: 6,993,342,122 Nm³/ano
- **AVES biogas after correction**: 2,331,114,041 Nm³/ano  
- **Total reduction**: 4,662,228,081 Nm³/ano
- **Reduction factor**: Exactly 3.00x (as expected)
- **New total biogas potential**: 49,327,262,804 Nm³/ano

## Affected Components
- ✅ **Database**: Corrected values in `data/database.db`
- ✅ **Livestock totals**: Automatically recalculated
- ✅ **Overall totals**: Automatically recalculated  
- ✅ **Map visualizations**: Will show corrected values
- ✅ **Charts and analysis**: Will use corrected data

## Validation
The correction has been validated by:
- Verifying the reduction factor is exactly 3.00x
- Confirming 577 municipalities were updated
- Checking that dependent totals were recalculated correctly
- Testing that the new values appear reasonable compared to other livestock sources

## Files Created
- `fix_aves_simple.py` - Correction script (can be archived)
- `AVES_CALCULATION_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Future Prevention
To prevent similar issues:
1. Always validate calculation results against expected ranges
2. Cross-check poultry biogas values with literature/benchmarks
3. Implement automated validation rules for extreme values
4. Document calculation methodologies clearly
